# Character Progression

## Currency (LUs)

- Lumina/Umbra (LUs) is also used as the unified currency for leveling & trading.
- 2 main currencies Lumina (light) and Umbra (shadow). Each could be gotten by performing light or dark actions.
- When user dies a portion or fixed amount of LUs is lost.
- LUs can be used to enter leveling quests (failure results in half of currency being refunded).
- Currency cannot be stored in banks, but part of the player's account.
- Fear of losing LUs should cause the player to prepare and strategize before entering a dungeon.
- Magic which should be rare also costs LUs.

## Levels

- Levels should not significantly increase the power of a player, but rather ensure that a player has the skills required to solo a dungeon.
- Levels are attained when a player spends currency to enter a leveling quest and completes it.
- Leveling quests are solo quests require a key to enter.
- LUs cost of leveling quests increases exponentially with each level.
- Skills, items, preparation, tactics and teamwork should be more important than levels.
- Current cap for level is set at 5
