/*
Faction affinity is not the same as the player's affinity (it is a general alignment, not a hard alignment).
Factions represent organizations in the world in which player's or monsters are a part of.
Factions do not represent races, though races have stereotypical factions.
Factions are mutable (mostly).
There maybe be goblin slaves inside a human faction, or evil humans who take part in a generally good/neutral faction.

The faction affinity is used for determining hostility between monsters/npcs and players.
